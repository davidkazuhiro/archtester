# Network Architecture Tester

The Network Architecture Tester (NAT) is a tool for testing whether a given network has a clean architecture. The software is designed to run on a Raspberry Pi environment, but is easily portable to other environments as well.

The tester architecture is configurable and network-driven; the device where the tester runs has a framework that supports user-defined testing methodology. One user may employ a basic connectivity test while another one may wish to check for path purity.
